How to Use\
Install Golly at https://golly.sourceforge.io, if the most recent version doesn’t work, this rule was made using Golly 5.0.\
Create a file called “BioChem.rule”, in the Golly program’s Rules folder. (***/golly-5.0-win-64bit/Rules on windows)\
Copy the Rule File text below into the file using a text editor.\
Open Golly, and click on BioChem.rule using the built in file manager.\
Create, react, and play around!
